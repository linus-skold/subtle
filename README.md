# subtle-todo

It's based on tauri 2.0 + react + next.js + tailwind + sqlite
Subtle todo is yet another todo list in an attempt to minimize clutter in a distracting world.

In my personal struggle in finding a decent way of making a todo list I ended up writing this todo app.
I've tried VSCode markdown, Obsidian todo plugins, Google todo, Physical paper, Post-its, .todo files, TaskWarrior, Super Productivity
just to name a few. 
And i just felt that none of them fit what I wanted from an app. I just wanted a really simple todo app that I didn't have to go online
to maintain, that wasn't over complicated with markdown and could do subtasks.


## Planned features

- Projects to group tasks and make it searchable
- Task details - to be able to describe tasks 
- Task tags - also for searching / grouping 
- Improved task creation
- Themes


## Maybe feature
- Syncing - Not sure how I would want to implement this as I don't want to use a server or have accounts
